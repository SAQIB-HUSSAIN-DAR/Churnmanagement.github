### Understanding Churn: The Key to Customer Retention

Have you ever wondered why some customers decide to stop doing business with a company? This phenomenon, known as churn, represents the percentage of customers who discontinue their relationship with a company over a specified period.

🔍 How is it measured?
Churn is tracked by monitoring the number of customers who cancel their subscription or service. This metric is crucial for understanding customer behavior and satisfaction.

❓ Why does it occur?
Churn can happen for various reasons:
- Poor customer service
- Lack of product quality
- High prices
- Competition offering better alternatives

📉 Effects of Churn
Understanding churn is essential for businesses. A high churn rate can significantly impact Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and indicate dissatisfaction with the product or service. It’s a signal that something needs to change.

💡 **Why calculating churn rate is crucial:**
1. **Identify root causes:** Pinpoint why customers are leaving.
2. **Predict future churn:** Anticipate potential customer loss.
3. **Develop strategies:** Create effective retention plans.
4. **Optimize operations:** Enhance overall business efficiency.

📊 What’s a good churn rate?
For subscription-based companies, a churn rate of 5-7% is generally considered healthy.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a subscription company’s data to analyze customer churn. The retention manager provided key inputs:
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer signed up for
- Customer account information
- Demographic information

After performing ETL processes and building measures, I created dashboards that reveal:
1. Yearly revenue generated
2. Monthly revenue
3. Subscription to different services
4. Customer demographics
5. Customer loyalty
6. Customer account information

Additionally, I developed another dashboard to identify customers at risk and their impact on overall revenue.
